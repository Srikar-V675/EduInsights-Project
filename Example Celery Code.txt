Handling multiple simultaneous requests to the `extract_results` endpoint and preventing a "too many requests" error requires a strategy to manage the rate limits at both the per-request and global levels. Here are some strategies you can implement:

1. **Global Rate Limiting**: Implement a global rate limit for the endpoint to ensure the total number of requests across all users doesn’t exceed the allowed rate.

2. **Per-User Rate Limiting**: Implement per-user rate limits to ensure individual users don’t overwhelm the system with too many requests.

3. **Centralized Throttling and Queueing**: Use a centralized queue system to manage and throttle the requests, ensuring they are processed at a controlled rate.

### Implementing Global and Per-User Rate Limiting in FastAPI

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi-limiter aioredis
   ```

2. **Setup Redis for Rate Limiting**:
   FastAPI-Limiter uses Redis to keep track of request counts and time windows.

3. **Update Your FastAPI Application**:

Here’s how you can set up global and per-user rate limiting in your FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, BackgroundTasks, Depends, HTTPException, Request
from fastapi_limiter import FastAPILimiter
from fastapi_limiter.depends import RateLimiter
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import time
import requests
from tenacity import retry, wait_exponential, stop_after_attempt, retry_if_exception_type
import aioredis

class TooManyRequestsException(Exception):
    pass

# Mock function to simulate a scraper that may hit rate limits
def mock_scraper(usn):
    response = requests.get(f"https://example.com/data/{usn}")
    if response.status_code == 429:
        raise TooManyRequestsException("Too many requests")
    return response.json()

@retry(
    retry=retry_if_exception_type(TooManyRequestsException),
    wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=60),
    stop=stop_after_attempt(5)
)
def scrape_and_store(section_id: int, usn_subset: list, db: Session):
    for usn in usn_subset:
        try:
            data = mock_scraper(usn)
            print(f"Stored data for {usn}")
        except TooManyRequestsException:
            print(f"Rate limit hit for {usn}, retrying...")
        time.sleep(1)

# Mock database session and function
def get_db():
    pass

class Section:
    id: int
    usn_range: list

def generate_usn_range(usn_range):
    return usn_range

app = FastAPI()

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup():
    redis = await aioredis.create_redis_pool("redis://localhost")
    await FastAPILimiter.init(redis)

@app.post("/extract/{section_id}", dependencies=[Depends(RateLimiter(times=5, seconds=60))])  # Global rate limit
async def extract_results(section_id: int, request: Request, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    section = db.query(Section).filter(Section.id == section_id).first()
    if not section:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Section not found")

    usn_range = generate_usn_range(section.usn_range)

    num_threads = 4
    subset_size = len(usn_range) // num_threads
    usn_subsets = [usn_range[i:i + subset_size] for i in range(0, len(usn_range), subset_size)]

    def process_subsets():
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_threads) as executor:
            futures = [executor.submit(scrape_and_store, section_id, subset, db) for subset in usn_subsets]
            for future in futures:
                future.result()

    background_tasks.add_task(process_subsets)
    return {"message": "Extraction process started"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Rate Limiting Dependency**:
   - `RateLimiter(times=5, seconds=60)`: This limits the endpoint to 5 requests per 60 seconds globally. Adjust these values based on your requirements.

2. **FastAPI-Limiter**:
   - `FastAPILimiter`: This library is used to handle rate limiting in FastAPI. It requires Redis to keep track of the request counts and time windows.

3. **Redis Setup**:
   - Ensure Redis is running on your system. You can install Redis using package managers like `apt` on Linux, `brew` on macOS, or download directly from the Redis website.

4. **Startup Event**:
   - During the startup of your FastAPI application, initialize the Redis connection and FastAPI-Limiter.

5. **Background Task Handling**:
   - The `process_subsets` function manages the multithreading for the usn_subsets, similar to the previous example, with retry logic to handle rate limits.

### Handling Multiple Requests

By implementing the rate limiter, you ensure that the number of requests to the `extract_results` endpoint is controlled. The retry logic with exponential backoff further ensures that if any request encounters a rate limit, it will wait and retry without overwhelming the target server.

For more advanced use cases, consider a distributed task queue system like Celery with Redis or RabbitMQ, which allows better control over task execution and retries.
